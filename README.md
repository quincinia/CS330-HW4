# CS330-HW4
 Web app using MVC pattern

 This app implements all the basic CRUD operations using vanilla JavaScript. The backend uses `json-server`, which handles the HTTP requests and saves your information into the `db.json` file.

 ## Usage
 This project requires use of the `json-server` package, which can be installed using `npm install`.

 Your `json-server` needs to be active before launching the app. Launch your server using `npm run server`.

 To start up the application, simply load the `index.html` file into your browser (preferrably Chrome).
